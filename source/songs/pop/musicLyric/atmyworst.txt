Can I call you baby?
Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is caving in (yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
If you stay forever, let me hold your hand
I can fill those places in your heart no else can
Let me show you love, oh, not pretend (yeah)

I'll be right here, baby, you know it's sink or swim
Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me
I need somebody who can love me
