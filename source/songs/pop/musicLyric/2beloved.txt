[Intro]
Sheesh
Mm
Girl, I'm 'bout to have a panic attack

[Verse 1]
I did the work, it didn't work, ah, ah (Mm, mm)
That truth, it hurts, goddamn it hurts, ah, ah (Goddamn, it hurts)
That lovey-dovey shit, was not a fan of it (Uh-uh)
I'm good with my friends, I don't want a man, girl
I'm in my bed, I'm way too fine to be here alone (Too fine)
On other hand, I know my worth, ah, ah
And now he callin' me (Brr), why do I feel like this?
What's happenin' to me? Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Am I ready (Girl, there ain't a doubt)
Am I ready (What you talkin' 'bout?)
Am I ready (You gon' figure it out)
To be loved, to be loved? (To be loved)
Am I ready? (You deserve it now)
'Cause I want it (That's what I'm talkin' about)
Am I ready (You gon' figure it out)
To be loved, to be loved?

[Verse 2]
How am I supposed to lovе somebody else (Shee, shee, shee)
Whеn I don't like myself? Like, ooh
Guess I better learn to like this, ooh (True)
It might take my whole life just to do (Damn, hey, hey)
He call me Melly (Ayy), he squeeze my belly (Yeah)
I'm too embarrassed (Ah) to say I like it
Girl, is this my boo? (Is this my boo?)
That's why I'm askin' you 'cause you know I've been through

[Chorus]
Am I ready (Girl, there ain't a doubt)
Am I ready (What you talkin' 'bout?)
Am I ready (You gon' figure it out)
To be loved (To be loved), to be loved? (To be loved)
Am I ready? (You deserve it now)
'Cause I want it (That's what I'm talkin' about)
Am I ready (You gon' figure it out)
To be loved, to be loved? (Yeah)

[Bridge]
You found me, I was fed up with the fantasy
What you wanna do? Think I'm ready, ooh
Think you like that, think you like that
When I clap back like that, let me know (Let me know)
You found me, I was fed up with the fantasy
What you wanna do? Think I'm ready, ooh
Think you like that, think you like that
When I clap back like that, let me know

[Chorus]
Am I ready (Girl, there ain't a doubt)
Am I ready (What you talkin' 'bout?)
Am I ready (You gon' figure it out)
To be loved (To be loved), to be loved? (To be loved)
Am I ready? (You deserve it now)
(Is you ready, ready, ready?)
'Cause I want it (That's what I'm talkin' about)
Am I ready (You gon' figure it out)
(Yeah, yeah, woo, woo, woo)
To be loved (To be loved), to be loved? (To be loved)

[Outro]
(Am I ready?)
Yesterday, I would have run away
And I don't know why
I don't know why (To be loved), know why (To be loved)
(Am I ready?)
Yesterday, I would have run away
And I don't know why (Did you know?)
I don't know why, but I'm ready
