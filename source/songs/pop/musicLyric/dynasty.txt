Some days
It's hard to see
If I was a fool
or you a thief

Made it through the maze
You found my one in a million
And now you're just a page torn from the story I'm building
And all I gave you is gone

Tumble (Y) like it was done
Thought we'd build a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake
Thought we'd build a dynasty, like nothing ever made
Thought we'd build a dynasty forever couldn't break up

The scar I can't reverse
When the more it heals, the worse it hurts
Gave you every piece of me,
Don't wanna risk missing
Don't know how to be so close to someone so distant

And all I gave you is gone
Tumble(?) like it was done
Thought we'd build a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake
Thought we'd build a dynasty, like nothing ever made
Thought we'd build a dynasty forever couldn't break up

It all fell down
It all fell down
It all fell
It all fell down
It all fell down
It all fell
It all fell down
It all fell down ehhh
It all fell down
It all fell down
It all fell down

And all I gave you is gone
Tumble(?) like it was done
Thought we'd build a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake
Thought we'd build a dynasty, like nothing ever made
Thought we'd build a dynasty forever couldn't break up

It all fell
It all fell down
It all fell down ehhh
It all fell down
It all fell down
It all fell down
(And all I gave you is gone)
It all fell
It all fell down
It all fell down

Thought we'd build a dynasty forever couldn't break up
