Intro
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Verse 1
Split mind, don't need to decide when
Straightforward, eyes on the climb when
I decide no matter the climate
Birthing bitches in my third trimester
Shift eyes, they tell me you lying
Don't care, just lay here beside me
Hang time chasing the rewind
Hang time

Pre-Chorus
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (Just you and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezing too tight, boy, you're losing me
Boy, you're losing

Chorus
Gone, gonе, girl, gone, girl
You better lеarn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replaces
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

Verse 2
Can't think, it's too hard to process
Get around you and I regress
I decide what demons I digest
Almost tired of repeating, I digress
Tryna find deeper meaning in nonsense
Tryna grow without hating the process
Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst)

Pre-Chorus
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (You and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezing too tight, boy, you're losing me
Boy, you're losing

Chorus
Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replaces
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

Bridge
Inward I go when there's no one around me
And memories drown me, the further I go
And ain't nobody talking 'bout the damage, pretending like it's all okay
I tried to erase, I live to escape

Chorus
Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
