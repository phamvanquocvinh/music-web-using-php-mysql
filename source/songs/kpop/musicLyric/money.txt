[Verse 1]
It's the end of the month and the weekend
I'ma spend this check, everything on me, yeah
I'ma tip myself, I'ma spend it on myself
I'ma drop it like it's pouring, I'ma pour it on myself

[Refrain]
Check, check, check, check that money
Making bank account number (Yikes)
That's that *** that's never getting bounced on ya'
Bitch, I do the money dance, I just made a hundred bands
When the store says sign for it
I'ma leave my autograph

[Pre-Chorus]
Dolla' bills, dolla' bills
Watch it fallin' for me
I love the way that feels
Dolla' bills, dolla' bills
Keep on fallin' for me
I love thе way it feels

[Chorus]
I came here to drop somе money, dropping all my money
Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah
Twerking, twerking, when I buy the things I like
Dolla', dollas, dropping on my ass tonight

[Verse 2]
Everyone silent, listen to my money talk
Spend how I like it
Yeah, everyone know what I mean, mean
When they see green, when they see green, that mean go
Give me what the hell I want, give me what the hell I want

[Refrain]
Check that money
Making bank account number (Yikes)
That's that *** that's never getting bounced on ya'
Bitch, I do the money dance, I just made a hundred bands
When the store says sign for it
I'ma leave my autograph

[Pre-Chorus]
Dolla' bills, dolla' bills
Watch it fallin' for me
I love the way that feels
Dolla' bills, dolla' bills
Keep on fallin' for me
I love the way it feels

[Chorus]
I came here to drop some money, dropping all my money
Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah
Twerking, twerking, when I buy the things I like
Dolla', dollas, dropping on my ass tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Drop some money, dropping all my money
Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah
Drop some money, dropping all my money
Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah

[Outro]
My money moves, money I choose
Celine my shoes, walkin' on you
My money rules, my money moves, money I choose
Watch how my wons and yens and dollars be droppin' on you
(Dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun)
Droppin' on you
(Dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun)
Droppin' on you
