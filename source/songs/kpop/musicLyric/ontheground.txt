[Verse 1]
My life's been magic, seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold's just plastic

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, every night
I've been thinkin' back on you and I
Every day, every night
[Chorus]
I worked my whole life
Just to get right, just to be like
"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"
I worked my whole life
Just to get high, just to realise
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground

[Post-Chorus]
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground
Nah, but they don't hear me though
(Yeah, what goes up, it must come down)
Nah, but they don't hear me though
(You're runnin' out of time)

[Verse 2]
My world's been hectic, seems electric
But I've been wakin' up with your voice in my head
And I'm tryna send a message and let you know
That every single minute I'm without you, I regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, every night
I've been thinkin' back on you and I
Every day, every night

[Chorus]
I worked my whole life
Just to get right, just to be like
"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"
I worked my whole life
Just to get high, just to realise
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground

[Post-Chorus]
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground
Nah, but they don't hear me though
(Yeah, what goes up, it must come down)
Nah, but they don't hear me though
(You're runnin' out of time)

[Bridge]
I'm way up in the clouds
And they say I've made it now
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the ground (Yeah, yeah)
Just drove by your house (Just drove by your house)
So far from you now (So far from you now)
But I figured it out
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
[Outro]
On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground
Nah, but they don't hear me though
On the ground
Nah, but they don't hear me though
Everything I need is on the ground
