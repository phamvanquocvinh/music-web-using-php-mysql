[Verse 1]
They're shutting down the protest, yeah, we're so on trend
Quick, go grab a picture, go get that content
You're stealing the attention, but it's a great look
Why do you wanna do good when you can feel good?

[Chorus]
I wanna be future-proof
Come and lift me up until I'm higher, higher
Vulture coming to steal my youth
Throw the pieces down into the fire, fire
Liars coming to take my truth
I wanna be future-proof
[Verse 2]
Oh, hang on, did I mention you're on the hit list?
Taking your intention, now it's irrelevant
There's poison in the water, and we deserve it
The future is a monster, and now it's turning

[Chorus]
I wanna be future-proof
Come and lift me up until I'm higher, higher
Vulture coming to steal my youth
Throw the pieces down into the fire, fire
Liars coming to take my truth
I wanna be future-proof

[Bridge]
There's a fire in the bedroom
On the forum, in the ether
There's a fire in the kitchen
In the species, in the creature
There's a fire at the party
In the summer, in the secret
There's a fire in the basement
On the lunar, in the dreamer
On the water
In the creature
In the body
In the species

Is Everybody Going Crazy?
Nothing But Thieves
Unperson
Nothing But Thieves
Particles
Nothing But Thieves
[Chorus]
I wanna be future-proof
Come and lift me up until I'm higher, higher
Vulture coming to steal my youth
Throw the pieces down into the fire, fire
Liars coming to take my truth
Oh, I wanna be future-proof
