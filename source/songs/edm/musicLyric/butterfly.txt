[Verse 1]
I’ve been searching for a man, all across Japan
Just to find you, find my samurai
Someone who is strong, but still a little shy
Yes I need, I need my samurai

[Chorus]
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue makes the colors in the sky
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue makes the colors in the sky
Green, black and blue (colors in the sky)
[Drop]
I’ve been searching for a man, all across Japan
Just to find you, find my samurai
Someone who is strong, but still a little shy
Yes I need, I need my samurai
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colors in the sky
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colors in the sky
I need my samurai (samurai)
Where’s my samurai?

[Verse 2]
I’ve been searching in the woods, and high upon the hills
Just to find you, find my samurai
Someone who won’t regret, to keep me in his net
Yes I need, I need my samurai

[Chorus]
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue makes the colors in the sky
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue makes the colors in the sky
I need my samurai (samurai)
Where’s my samurai?

[Drop]
I’ve been searching for a man, all across Japan
Just to find you, find my samurai
Someone who is strong, but still a little shy
Yes I need, I need my samurai
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colors in the sky
I, I, I’m your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colors in the sky
I, I, I, where’s my samurai?
I, I, I, where’s my samurai?
