If all of the kings
Had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens Who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own 

If all of the kings
Had their queens on the throne We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens Who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own

Can't live without me You wanna, but you can't, no, no, no
Think it's funny, but honey Can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake There's only so much I can take
I'll show you How a real queen behaves, oh

No damsel in distress Don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire You can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one It'd be bigger than yours

If all of the kings Had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens Who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own If all of the kings

Had their queens on the throne We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens Who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own

Disobey me, then baby
It's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it
A world you won't forget
I can feel my body shake
There's only so much I can take
I'll show you How a real queen behaves, oh

No damsel in distress
Don't need to save me Once
I start breathin' fire
You can't tame me
And you might think
I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

If all of the kings
Had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens Who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own

In chess The king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go Wherever they like You get too close
You'll get a royalty high So breathe it in to feel the love
