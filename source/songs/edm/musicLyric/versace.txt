Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit
Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit
Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit
Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit

[Drop]
Go wish, go wish, go wish
Go wish, go wish, go wish
Go wish, go wish, go wish

[Verse]
Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit
Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit
Versace on my wrist
Baby make a wish
You could sell your 'rari
But you can't afford my outfit

[Drop]
Go wish, go wish, go wish
Go wish, go wish, go wish
Go wish, go wish, go wish
