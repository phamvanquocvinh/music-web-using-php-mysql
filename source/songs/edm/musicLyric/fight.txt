[Intro]
It hurts so good
It's so good

[Verse 1]
I will always call you mine
I need your love
Please me, baby, don't be shy
I'll keep you close

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you're thinking about
I won't ever let you down
You can come and touch me now
I will always stick around
We're playing truth or dare
Your love is so unfair
I can feel it in the air
But you don't care
[Chorus]
It hurts so good
You make me feel alive
Just kiss me like you do
Baby, you're my type
It hurts so good
You keep me up all night
I know we'll make it through
I don't wanna fight

[Drop]
It hurts so good
I don't wanna fight
It's so good
I don't wanna
It hurts so good
I don't wanna fight (Fight, fight)

[Verse 2]
I will always take you high
You're not alone
Tease me, baby, cloud my mind
Don't let me fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you're thinking about
I wonâ€™t ever let you down
You can come and touch me now
I will always stick around
We're playing truth or dare
Your love is so unfair
I can feel it in the air
But you don't care

[Chorus]
It hurts so good
You make me feel alive
Just kiss me like you do
Baby, you're my type
It hurts so good
You keep me up all night
I know we'll make it through
I don't wanna fight

[Drop]
It hurts so good
I don't wanna fight
It's so good
I don't wanna
It hurts so good
I don't wanna fight (Fight, fight)

[Bridge]
I'll never find someone like you
When I look in your eyes, I feel so good
Give me a sign you feel it too
Where are you now when I need you

[Chorus]
It hurts so good
You make me feel alive
Just kiss me like you do
Baby, you're my type
It hurts so good
You keep me up all night
I know we'll make it through
I don't wanna fight
[Drop]
It hurts so good
I don't wanna fight
It's so good
I don't wanna
It hurts so good
I don't wanna fight (Fight, fight)
