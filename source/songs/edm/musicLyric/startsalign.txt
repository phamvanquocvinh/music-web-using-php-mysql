[Verse 1]
Can I go back to the days that I had you?
Back to one more night like we're used to
I miss every minute we've been through
From the hardest part to the best you

[Refrain]
Make the stars align
Words cannot describe
Don't need no more goodbyes
You leave me hypnotized
Make the stars align
I need you here tonight
Don't need no more goodbyes
It leaves me hypnotized
[Pre-Chorus]
One last time like
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da

[Chorus]
(Make the stars align)

[Verse 2]
When our hands are holding each other
I can't see myself with another
I will go through fire and water
Turn the whole life back into colour

[Refrain]
Make the stars align
Words cannot describe
Don't need no more goodbyes
You leave my hypnotized
Make the stars align
I need you here tonight
Don't need no more goodbyes
It leaves me hypnotized

[Bridge]
One last time like
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da

[Refrain]
Make the stars align
Words cannot describe
Don't need no more goodbyes
You leave my hypnotized
Make the stars align
I need you here tonight
Don't need no more goodbyes
It leaves me hypnotized

[Pre-Chorus]
One last time like
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ra-da

[Chorus]
(Make the stars align)
