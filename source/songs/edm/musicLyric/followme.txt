[Verse 1]
When the days stop hurting and the rain has dried
I know you're the person I want by my side
Scared to let my heart go free and dive in blind
'Cause love and heartbreak, they walk a thin line

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, nobody can love me like you
But that means you got the power to hurt me too

[Chorus]
When I fall in deep, say you'll follow me
'Cause I really need to know
That you'll stick around when my walls come down
Won't be fazed by what's underneath
Yeah, you know I've been hurt
But I'm learnin' what love's like with you, like with you
Oh, whеn I fall in deep, say you'll follow me
Show me how far we can go
[Drop]
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say you'll follow mе, say you'll follow me
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me

[Verse 2]
I have my reasons for takin' it slow
'Cause we all got demons, yeah, we all got ghosts
But every time I've broken down, you've picked me up
Yeah, you put back all the pieces I thought that I'd lost

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, nobody can love me like you
But that means you got the power to hurt me too

[Chorus]
When I fall in deep, say you'll follow me
'Cause I really need to know
That you'll stick around when my walls come down
Won't be phased by what's underneath
Yeah, you know I've been hurt
But I'm learnin' what love's like with you, like with you
Oh, when I fall in deep, say you'll follow me
Show me how far we can go

[Bridge]
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Show me how far we can go

[Drop]
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say you'll follow me, say you'll follow me

[Outro]
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Say you'll follow me
Say you’ll follow me
