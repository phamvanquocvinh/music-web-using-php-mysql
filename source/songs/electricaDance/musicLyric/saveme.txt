I
See the light inside your eyes
You make me feel like
I'm awake
I
Don't know why
You make me shine
Like a Star in the sky
I'm Ok
I
Wanna take a breath
I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love...!
I
Wanna hold your hand
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone...!

[ĐK:]
You get me high
Oh yeah...!
Be by my side
Baby yeah...!
Only you can save me
Only you can save me...!

I
Hold your tight
You blow my mind
Like a bottle of wine
I'm insane
I
Come alive
You drive my wild
When I kiss you at night
I'm Ok...!
I
Wanna take a breath
I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love...!
I
Wanna hold your hand
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone...!

[ĐK:]
You get me high
Oh yeah...!
Be by my side
Baby yeah...!
Only you can save me
Only you can save me...!

You get me high
Oh yeah...!
Be by my side
Baby yeah...!
Only you can save me
Only you can save me...!
