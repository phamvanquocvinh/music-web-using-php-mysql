Trying to forget you
I'm all alone
In a ghost town.

There's a beautiful madness
Inside my soul
And I can't stop
Thinking of you
Walking on a loney avenue
Are you? Are you? Are you?

My love is so wild
Please give me a sign
My love is so wild
Please give me, baby
My love is so wild
Please give me a sign
My love is so wild
Please give me a sign

Please give me a sign

Fading in the dark
All the lights
Go down
I'm feeling high and drunk
Close my eyes
And I'm can't stop
Thinking of you
Walking on a lone avenue
Are you? Are you? Are you?

My love so wild
Please give me a sign
My love is so wild
Please give me, baby
