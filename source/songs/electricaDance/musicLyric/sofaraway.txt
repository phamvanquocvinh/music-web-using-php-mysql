[Verse 1: Jamie Scott]
Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
Summer nights, bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Calling you now, but you're not picking up
Shadows so close if that's still enough
Light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
So far away

[Verse 2: Romy Dya]
It's breaking me, losing you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried
But never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Dya]
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's still close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now
But somehow it still breaks my heart
We could have had this talk
Oh

[Chorus: Romy Dya & Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Romy Dya & Jamie Scott]
So far away
So far away, oh
So far away
So far away

[Outro: Romy Dya]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
