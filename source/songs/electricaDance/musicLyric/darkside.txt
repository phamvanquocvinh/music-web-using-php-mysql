[Intro]
(D-D-Darkside)

[Verse 1: Tomine Harket]
We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
[Chorus: Tomine Harket]
Take me through the night
Fall into the darkside
We don't need the light
We'll live on the darkside
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the darkside

[Post-Chorus: Tomine Harket]
Fall into the darkside
Give in to the darkside
Let go of the light
Fall into the darkside

[Verse 2: Au/Ra]
Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're runnin' out of time (Time, time)
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

[Pre-Chorus: Au/Ra]
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel it
No secrets worth keepin'
So fool me like I'm dreamin'

[Chorus: Tomine Harket & Au/Ra]
Take me through the night
Fall into the darkside
We don't need the light
We'll live on the darkside
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the darkside

[Post-Chorus: Tomine Harket & Au/Ra]
Fall into the darkside
Give in to the darkside
Let go of the light
Fall into the darkside

[Bridge]
(D-D-Darkside)
(Darkside)
(Darkside)
(Darkside)

[Chorus: Tomine Harket & Au/Ra]
Take me through the night
Fall into the darkside
We don't need the light
We'll live on the darkside
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the darkside
